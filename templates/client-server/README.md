# Template: Client + Server

A full-stack app with an Express 5 backend and a vanilla TypeScript frontend. Use this when you need API routes, secret management, or server-side logic alongside a client.

**Tier 2** — client + server, no database.

## Stack

Express 5 + vanilla TypeScript client + tsx (dev hot-reload)

## Usage

```sh
pnpm dev        # builds client, starts server at localhost:3000 (auto-restarts)
pnpm build      # compile both client and server
pnpm start      # run production build
pnpm test       # run tests
```

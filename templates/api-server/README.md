# Template: API Server

An Express 5 backend. Use this for REST APIs, webhooks, or services that don't serve a frontend.

**Tier 2** — server only, no client.

## Stack

Express 5 + TypeScript + tsx (dev hot-reload)

## Usage

```sh
pnpm dev        # dev server at localhost:3000 (auto-restarts on changes)
pnpm build      # compile to dist/
pnpm start      # run production build
pnpm test       # run tests
```
